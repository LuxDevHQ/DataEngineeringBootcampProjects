### Project Guide: Build a Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline Using Apache Kafka and Cassandra (or MongoDB)

**Level:** Intermediate – Advanced  
**Tools Required:** Python, Apache Kafka, Cassandra (or MongoDB), a public Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap)

---

 **Project Description**  
In this hands-on project, you'll learn how to:
- Stream live weather data from a public API
- Send it through Apache Kafka (a distributed streaming platform)
- Store the data in Cassandra or MongoDB for real-time storage and analysis

You'll complete these key steps:
1. Set up Apache Kafka and Cassandra/MongoDB
2. Connect to a weather data API
3. Implement both a Kafka producer (data sender) and consumer (data receiver/storer)

**Pro Tip:** Services like Aiven.io offer free-tier instances of Cassandra/MongoDB to start quickly without local installation.

**Ideal for:**
- Practicing real-time data engineering
- Understanding stream processing
- Applying Kafka in practice
- Exploring NoSQL solutions
